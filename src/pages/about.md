Hello there, curious human! Welcome to the chaotic yet strangely charming world of yours truly.

I’m a **Linux software developer** - which basically means I spend my days talking to a computer in a language only a few brave souls understand, trying to convince it to do things without throwing a tantrum. Sometimes it listens, sometimes it just laughs at me. Either way, it's never boring.

When I’m not wrestling with code, I wield a camera like a modern-day wizard. **Photography** is my artsy escape, capturing moments that I later pretend I actually planned to take. Spoiler: most of the time, it's just dumb luck and quick fingers.

Oh, and **motorcycles**? Yeah, I ride those too. Because why not throw a little speed and danger into the mix? There’s nothing like the wind in your face and the sheer thrill of wondering if you remembered to put on clean underwear.

Above all, I’m just a person on a quest to be “optimal” (whatever that means). I try to optimize my life, but mostly I optimize my coffee intake and the number of times I hit snooze. Perfection is overrated anyway - embracing the chaos is way more fun.

So that’s me in a nutshell: part **coder**, part **shutterbug**, part **speed demon**, and part-time **optimist** (with questionable success).
