- The next driver picked me up successfully. He tried every effort to tell me his car isn't permitted... downloaded a translation app
- Stay in a hotel, which hundreds year history. Old, hausting, no window. Elevator running noisy. Beautiful patio? Seeing old scenic sites from balcony, if walking to patio

- People with a guitar on his back... everywhere
- Lots of police walking, riding bikes and motorcycles
