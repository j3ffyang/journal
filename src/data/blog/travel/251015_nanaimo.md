Hey there! That's actually a really good question, and honestly, we've been wondering the same thing ourselves for a while now. Some of our friends have even suggested we should just follow our kids out there. Here's what's been going through my head, and maybe we can chat about it more later.

## The Scenery is Absolutely Stunning

So last July, right after we landed in Vancouver, we did this epic road trip through British Columbia. We hit up Whistler (you know, that famous ski resort town that hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics), Hope (where they filmed Stallone's First Blood back in 1982 - yeah, that movie was shot in Canada to save money), Kamloops, and Revelstoke (which was actually the original headquarters of the Canadian Pacific Railway back in the 1880s - pretty cool history there). 

Our original plan was to make it all the way to Banff in Alberta (about 280km from Revelstoke), but we just didn't have enough time for the round trip. The landscapes out there are completely different from anything you see around Toronto or Montreal - we're talking about these massive mountain ranges, pristine lakes, and forests that go on forever. It's like stepping into a postcard.

## The Weather is Actually Perfect for Motorcycle Riding

Here's the thing about BC winters - they barely dip below freezing, which is a huge change from Toronto's brutal snowstorms. When we arrived in July, Beijing was hitting almost 40°C while Vancouver was sitting pretty at 18°C - I actually needed a jacket in the mornings during summer! 

I've been looking into motorcycles because I think we could ride year-round out there. In Toronto, riding is basically impossible for half the year due to all that heavy snow. Though I have to admit, everyone keeps warning me that Vancouver gets super rainy - like more than 50% of the time. We'll see how that goes, I guess.

## Cost of Living Makes Sense

Since we don't need to be physically present in the big cities for work, we don't really have to stick around Toronto or Vancouver. The place we're looking at is about 120km from Vancouver, so we could live somewhere quiet and affordable while still being close enough to the city when we need it. Why not, right?

## The Adventure Factor

As long as we're free and don't have to be stuck in an office or tied down with family obligations, we want to travel. Japan and Italy are still calling my name, and being on the west coast would make those trips so much easier.

## Family Considerations

We want our kids to live close by, but not too close, you know? We're hoping to explore the West Coast and find some nice, quiet spots that the kids might actually want to visit. They'll need some guidance and encouragement, and I'm totally up for that role.

## Geographic Advantage

British Columbia is way closer to Asia (though farther from Europe, obviously). A direct flight from Vancouver to Japan is only about 10 hours, and then it's just 3 hours from there to Beijing. That's a game-changer for us.

## Keeping Our Options Open

The best part? We're not locking ourselves into anything. We might end up back in Toronto eventually, or we might fall in love with the west coast. We don't have to decide everything right now, and that's actually pretty freeing.

That’s a great question. We’ve actually been wondering the same thing for a while. Some of our friends even suggested that we should tag along with our kids. Here’s what I think for now, and maybe we can chat more about it later.

The scenery is pretty amazing. Last July, right after landing in Vancouver, we drove around a bunch of cities and towns in British Columbia — places like Whistler, Hope (where they filmed Stallone’s First Blood back in ’82 — yeah, that movie was shot in Canada to save money), Kamloops, and Revelstoke (which was the original HQ of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s). Our main goal was to get to Banff in Alberta, which is about 280 kilometers from Revelstoke, but we just didn’t have enough time to make the round trip. The landscapes there are way different and unique compared to Toronto, Montreal, and other places around.

As for the weather, winters in British Columbia barely dip below freezing. When we arrived in Beijing, it was almost 40°C, but Vancouver was just around 18 — kinda chilly in the mornings even in summer. I think it’s a good spot for riding motorcycles. I checked out some bikes, but riding in Toronto is basically impossible for half the year. I also heard (and got warned) that Vancouver is super rainy — like more than 50% of the time. So, we’ll see how that goes.

The cost of living is another thing. Since we don’t have to be onsite in the cities for work, we don’t really need to live right in Toronto or Vancouver. The place we’re thinking about is about 120 kilometers from Vancouver. It’d be nice to live somewhere quiet and affordable. Why not, right?

When it comes to exploring, as long as we’re free and don’t have to work in an office or be stuck with the kids (or parents) all the time, we want to travel. Like I said before, Japan and Italy are still places that really catch my eye.

We want our kids to live close by, but still keep a bit of distance. We wanna explore the West to find some chill, nice spots that the kids might like. They’ll need some guidance and courage, and I’m happy to help with that.

Also, British Columbia is pretty close to Asia, though it’s farther from Europe. Direct flights from Vancouver to Japan take about 10 hours, and then it’s just around 3 hours back to Beijing.

Anyway, we’re not locked into staying in British Columbia. We might end up back in Toronto. We don’t need to decide everything right now. -->
