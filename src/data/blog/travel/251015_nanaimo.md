@Guido - that was a good question. We've considered the same curiously for a while. And some of our friends thought we should accompany (follow) our kids. Here's what I can answer and maybe we discuss later

1. The scenery - We drove to several cities/ towns in British Columbia in July, after getting landed in Vancouver. They're Whistler, Hope (where Stallone's First Blood was filmed in 1982. Yeah that movie was filmed in Canada for budget reason), Kamloops, Revelstoke (the original headquarter of Canadian Pacific Railway company in 1880's). Our original destination was Banff (280KMs from Revelstoke), Alberta. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to drive to and come back (saved the trip for the future). Their scenery are quite different and unique from Toronto, Montreal and around. 

2. The weather - The temperature in British Columbia in winter is barely under zero degrees. And in July, when we came to Canada, Beijing was close to 40 degrees and Vancouver was just 18 (chilly in the morning in summer). I think it's good for us to ride motorcycle all year round. I looked around for motor-bikes but ride is completely IMPOSSIBLE for half year in Toronto due to frequent heave snow in winter. However, I was told (warned) that it's very wet and rainy in Vancouver, more than 50%. So we'll see.

3. The expense. Since we don't have to work onsite in cities, we don't really have to stay in Toronto nor Vancouver (the place we're going to is 120KMs away from Vancouver). It'd be good if living in a quiet and inexpensive place. Why not?

4. The advanture. As long as we're free, don't have to work in office, don't have to get stuck with kids (or parents), we'd like to travel. As I mentioned before, Japan and Italy are still attracting my interest.

5. We wish to have kids live close to us (still need to keep some distance). We want to explore the West and see whether there's some quiet and nice place where kids might like. They need guidance and courage. I like to do that.

6. British Columbia is close to Asia (far to Enrope though). The direct flight from Vancouver to Japan is only 10 hours. From there, it'd take ~3 hours to get back to Beijing.

Anyway, we don't really have to lock ourselves in British Columbia. We may come back to Toronto. We don't have to decide at this moment.

That’s a great question. We’ve actually been wondering the same thing for a while. Some of our friends even suggested that we should tag along with our kids. Here’s what I think for now, and maybe we can chat more about it later.

The scenery is pretty amazing. Last July, right after landing in Vancouver, we drove around a bunch of cities and towns in British Columbia — places like Whistler, Hope (where they filmed Stallone’s First Blood back in ’82 — yeah, that movie was shot in Canada to save money), Kamloops, and Revelstoke (which was the original HQ of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s). Our main goal was to get to Banff in Alberta, which is about 280 kilometers from Revelstoke, but we just didn’t have enough time to make the round trip. The landscapes there are way different and unique compared to Toronto, Montreal, and other places around.

As for the weather, winters in British Columbia barely dip below freezing. When we arrived in Beijing, it was almost 40°C, but Vancouver was just around 18 — kinda chilly in the mornings even in summer. I think it’s a good spot for riding motorcycles. I checked out some bikes, but riding in Toronto is basically impossible for half the year. I also heard (and got warned) that Vancouver is super rainy — like more than 50% of the time. So, we’ll see how that goes.

The cost of living is another thing. Since we don’t have to be onsite in the cities for work, we don’t really need to live right in Toronto or Vancouver. The place we’re thinking about is about 120 kilometers from Vancouver. It’d be nice to live somewhere quiet and affordable. Why not, right?

When it comes to exploring, as long as we’re free and don’t have to work in an office or be stuck with the kids (or parents) all the time, we want to travel. Like I said before, Japan and Italy are still places that really catch my eye.

We want our kids to live close by, but still keep a bit of distance. We wanna explore the West to find some chill, nice spots that the kids might like. They’ll need some guidance and courage, and I’m happy to help with that.

Also, British Columbia is pretty close to Asia, though it’s farther from Europe. Direct flights from Vancouver to Japan take about 10 hours, and then it’s just around 3 hours back to Beijing.

Anyway, we’re not locked into staying in British Columbia. We might end up back in Toronto. We don’t need to decide everything right now.
