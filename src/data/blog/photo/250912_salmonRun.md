So, my family got into a lively debate about where and how to catch the Salmon Run action near Toronto, in Canada. We had heard about it online, but then a fisherman buddy of mine chimes in, saying, "Nah, it’s probably done—government banned salmon fishing since early September." 

Meanwhile, we’ve already gathered a list of spots around Ontario to go salmon spotting, so now it’s a toss-up between “Is it even happening?” and “Where do we go watch these fish do their thing?” Classic family debate mode!

Later I generated a `prompt` for query and done a search. The output listed in **Answers from Google Gemini** definitely came from web. 

## Query Prompt

```txt
In Ontario, within 100 kms near by Toronto, where can the Salmon Run be seen? 

- list the places with the distance from Toronto downtown, in a table
- columned by location name, town name, Google Maps rating, distance, and best viewing description
- convert the list in markdown format # this one doesn't work well
- sort the list by rating on Google Maps from high to low
- categorize them by direction, such as east, west and north of Toronto
```
