# Choosing between OpenCode and Claude Code

I care a lot about **open source**, **picking my own model**, and **not being locked into one vendor’s stack**. That bias shapes how I compare these two ways of running **Claude Opus** (and other models) against your repo and shell.

Both let you chat with the codebase and run terminal work; the difference is mostly **who owns the knobs**—you, or a tightly integrated product.

**How I slice it:** OpenCode vs. Claude Code (with Opus when applicable)

| | **OpenCode** | **Claude Code** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What it optimizes for** | **Horizontal flexibility**: UI and model are decoupled; lots of providers (75+). | **Vertical polish**: tuned for Anthropic’s models and tooling. |
| **Model choice** | **Swap mid-session**—e.g. Opus for planning, something cheaper for boilerplate—or **free tiers** on aggregators. | **Claude-only** in practice (Haiku / Sonnet / Opus). |
| **Where you live** | Desktop, web, and a busy **TUI** with modes/tabs. | A **very polished CLI** that feels “native” to Claude. |
| **Agents** | **YAML / markdown** agents you wire yourself—powerful, more setup. | **Built-in subagents** (Plan, Explore, Task) that just work. |
| **Undo story** | **Plain Git** for `/undo` (repo must be Git). | **Snapshots** (Esc twice)—fast, proprietary. |
| **What I’ve noticed** | Often more thorough, more tests generated. | Often **faster** (~45% in some comparisons) and strong on benchmarks like SWE-bench Pro. |

## What I actually prefer

- **Open source**—I like tools I can read, fork, and reason about.
- **Decoupled model** so I can chase **free or cheap** options when I want—e.g. [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super on OpenRouter (free tier)](https://openrouter.ai/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free)—not only Opus.
- **Git-native** flow: versions live in **normal Git**, not only in an app-specific checkpoint format.

I’ll be honest: **my time in Claude Code has been great**—it handles repos and multi-file edits in a way that feels effortless. I’m not trying to bring it down. So far it's the best; I’m explaining **why I still lean OpenCode** for day-to-day philosophy.

## When OpenCode wins *for me*

- **Hybrid cost**: Opus (or similar) for hard bits, then **switch down** for repetitive churn.
- **Agents & skills** as **markdown/ YAML** in my repo—matches how I already document habits.
- **Remote / server**: client–server layout is handy for Docker or driving a session from another box via HTTP.

## When I’d still grab Claude Code

- **Tight Claude integration**: tool use and context often feel **more predictable** without me tuning YAML.
- **Subscription math**: if you're already on **Pro/ Max**, the CLI can beat **pay-per-token** through a generic client.
- **Low-friction experiments**: **snapshots** beat “commit everything” when I’m spiking and don’t want Git noise yet.
